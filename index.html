            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              I started taking pictures intentionally during high school when I took a photoshop & mixed media class. There I learned certain techniques on how to frame my subject. From these beginning stages my passion for photography continued. Any time I took a photo I would revert back to the priciples I had learnt while studying proper techniques. Over time, as I upgraded my knowledge I upgraded my camera equipment as well. I started out using a fuji film digital camera slowly evolving into a canon dslr. Thank you for visiting!
